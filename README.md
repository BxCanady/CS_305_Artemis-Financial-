Vulnerability Assessment Report of Artemis Financial 

ðŸ”¹ About the Client
Artemis Financial is a company that handles sensitive financial transactions through a web-based application. They needed help finding and fixing security issues to protect client data and stay compliant with laws.

ðŸ”¹ What I Did
Reviewed their software to understand security needs.

Found vulnerabilities through manual code review and static testing.

Used OWASP Dependency-Check to scan for outdated and risky libraries.

Made a plan to fix all the problems without breaking the app.

ðŸ”¹ What Went Well
Found important issues like hardcoded passwords, missing input validation, and old libraries.

Added better input checks.

Suggested encryption updates.

Recommended HTTPS-only communication.

Planned for safer session management and CSRF protection.

In the future, I would also use tools like OWASP ZAP for deeper testing.

ðŸ”¹ Testing and Validation
After proposing fixes, I re-checked the project using static scans.

Made sure no new problems were introduced.

ðŸ”¹ Tools and Skills Used
Maven

OWASP Dependency-Check

Manual code review

Secure coding best practices
